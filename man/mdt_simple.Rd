\usage{
mdt_simple(data, IV, DV, M)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a dataframe containing the variables in the model.}

\item{IV}{an unquoted numeric variable in the data frame which will be used
as independant variable.}

\item{DV}{an unquoted numeric variable in the data frame which will be used
as dependant variable.}

\item{M}{an unquoted numeric variable in the data frame which will be used
as mediator.}
}
\value{
Returns an object of class "\code{mediation_model}" object.

An object of class "\code{mediation_model}" is a least containing at list the
components:

  \item{type}{A character string containing the type of model that has been
    conducted (e.g., \code{"simple mediation"}).}
  \item{method}{A character string containing the approach that has been
    used to conduct the mediation analysis (usually
    \code{"joint significance"}).}
  \item{params}{Score at a 3-item measure of hypodescent}
  \item{paths}{Score at a 3-item measure of hypodescent}
  \item{indirect_index}{A boolean indicating wether mediation index has been
    computed. Defaults to \code{FALSE}. See \code{\link{add_index}} to
    compute mediation index.}
  \item{indirect_index_infos}{(Optional) An object of class
    \code{"indirect_index"}. Appears when one apply \code{\link{add_index}}
    method to an object of class \code{"mediation_model"}.}
  \item{js_models}{A list of objects of class \code{"lm"}. Contains every
    model fitted to apply joint significance approach.}
  \item{data}{The original data frame that has been been passed through
    \code{data} argument.}
}
\description{
Given a dataframe, an IV (\code{IV}), a DV (\code{DV}) and a mediator
(\code{M}), \code{mdt_simple} fits a simple mediation model using joint
significance method (Judd, Yzerbyt, & Muller, 2014).

\details{
In a simple mediation analysis, researchers are intrested in finding if the
effect of \eqn{X} on \eqn{Y} involve a third variable \eqn{M}. The basic
hypothesis behind this test is that \eqn{X} has an effect on \eqn{M} which
has an effect on \eqn{Y}: meaning that \eqn{X} has an indrect effect on
\eqn{Y} through \eqn{M}.

Total effect of \eqn{X} on \eqn{Y} can be described the following way:

\deqn{c = c' + ab}

where \eqn{c} is the total effect of \eqn{X} on \eqn{Y}, \eqn{c'} is the
direct of \eqn{X} on \eqn{Y}, and \eqn{ab} is the indirect effect of \eqn{X}
on \eqn{Y} through {M}.

To assess if the indirect effect is different from the null, one has to
assess the significance against the null for both \eqn{a} (the effect of
\eqn{X} on \eqn{M}) for and \eqn{b} (effect of \eqn{M} on \eqn{Y} controlling
for the effect of \eqn{X}) through the following set of linear models:

\deqn{Y_i = \beta_{01} + c X_i}{Yi = \beta_01 + c*Xi}
\deqn{M_i = \beta_{02} + a X_i}{Mi = \beta_02 + a*Xi}
\deqn{Y_i = \beta_{03} + c' X_i + b M_i}{Yi = \beta_03 + c'*Xi + b*Mi}

In joint significance mediation analysis approach, bot \eqn{a} and \eqn{b}
must be significantly different from the null to conclude on the
significance of the indirect effect.
