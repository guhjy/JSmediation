\title{Fit a moderated mediation model}
\usage{
mdt_moderated(data, IV, DV, M, Mod)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A dataframe containing the variables in the model.}

\item{IV}{An unquoted variable in the data frame which will be used
as independant variable.}

\item{DV}{An unquoted variable in the data frame which will be used
as dependant variable.}

\item{M}{An unquoted variable in the data frame which will be used
as mediator.}

\item{Mod}{An unquoted variable in the data frame which will be used
as moderator.}
}
\value{
Returns an object of class "\code{mediation_model}" object.

An object of class "\code{mediation_model}" is a least containing at list the
components:

  \item{type}{A character string containing the type of model that has been
    conducted (e.g., \code{"simple mediation"}).}
  \item{method}{A character string containing the approach that has been
    used to conduct the mediation analysis (usually
    \code{"joint significance"}).}
  \item{params}{Score at a 3-item measure of hypodescent}
  \item{paths}{Score at a 3-item measure of hypodescent}
  \item{indirect_index}{A boolean indicating wether mediation index has been
    computed. Defaults to \code{FALSE}. See \code{\link{add_index}} to
    compute mediation index.}
  \item{indirect_index_infos}{(Optional) An object of class
    \code{"indirect_index"}. Appears when one apply \code{\link{add_index}}
    method to an object of class \code{"mediation_model"}.}
  \item{js_models}{A list of objects of class \code{"lm"}. Contains every
    model fitted to apply joint significance approach.}
  \item{data}{The original data frame that has been been passed through
    \code{data} argument.}
}
\description{
Given a dataframe, an IV, a DV, a mediator and a moderator, fit
a moderated mediation model.
}
\details{
This function is an helper to fit linear models needed to test a
moderated mediation model. The join-significant formal approach has been
described in Muller, Judd, & Yzerbyt (2005).

Three models will be fit:
