\title{Fit a moderated mediation model}
\usage{
mdt_moderated(...)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a dataframe containing the variables in the model.}

\item{IV}{an unquoted variable in the data frame which will be used
as independant variable.}

\item{M}{an unquoted variable in the data frame which will be used
as mediator.}

\item{DV}{an unquoted variable in the data frame which will be used
as dependant variable.}

\item{Moderator}{an unquoted variable in the data frame which will be used
as moderator.}
}
\description{
Given a dataframe, an IV, a DV, a mediator and a moderator, fit a moderated
mediation model.
}
\details{
This function is an helper to fit linear models needed to test a
moderated mediation model. The Joint Significant formal approach has been
described in Muller, Judd, & Yzerbyt (2005).

Three models will be fit:

\deqn{\hat{Y_i} = \Beta_0 + \Beta_1 X_i + \Beta_2 Mod_i + \Beta_3
     X_i Mod_i}{Yi = B0 + B1X + B2Mod + B3XMod}
\deqn{\hat{M_i} = \Beta_0 + \Beta_1 X_i + \Beta_2 Mod_i + \Beta_3
     X_i Mod_i}{Yi = B0 + B1X + B2Mod + B3XMod}

\deqn{\hat{M_i} = \Beta_0 + \Beta_1 X_i + \Beta_2 Mod_i + \Beta_3
     X_i Mod_i}{Yi = B0 + B1X + B2Mod + B3XMod}
}
